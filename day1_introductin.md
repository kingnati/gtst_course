Why hack happens?
★ ATTACKS = MOTIVE(GOAL) + METHOD +
VULNERABILITY
★ MOTIVE:- Information theft, manipulating data,
Financial loss,Revenge, Ransom, Damaging
Reputation.
Elements of Information security
★ CIA triad
ታማኝነት
ሚስጥራዊነት
ተገኝነት
Skills we need to be hacker
★ Programming
★ Networking
★ Linux
★ System admin
Phases of Hacking
1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Gaining Access
4. Maintaining Access
5. Clearing Tracks or Logs
Penetration Testing
★ Penetration Testing is a method of evaluating
the security of an information system or
network by simulating an attack to
★ find vulnerability
★ Security Measures
★ Documentation and Report Preparation
Why we need Penetration Testing?
★ Identification of threats
★ Security Protections and controls
★ Assessment of Organization's Security
★ Evaluation of Network Security
★ Upgradation of Infrastructure.
Types of Pentesting

● So, always have “PERMISSION!”.
● Ethiopia have a Cyber Crime Law called “የኮምፒዩተር ወንጀል አዋጅ”.
It have 6 parts. It is detailed on some attacks.
● Lets see some ethiopian Cyber Laws.
● We as a Ethical Hackers, Our Goal and the Goal of this course is
“To Create a Safe and Theatless Environment To humans”.

blackHat, so any examples i mention in this course can look like
blackhat concept but try to understand that those examples are
just for “ Educational Purpose”
Jobs with Ethical Hacking
● Cyber Security Expert
● Security Analyst
● Cyber Security Consultant
● Web penetration tester
● Internal and External Penetration tester
● Network Security Tester
● Bug Hunter
It is the Era for
Security
Engineers.
BE READY! And Still In Ethiopia People don’t
know about it!
